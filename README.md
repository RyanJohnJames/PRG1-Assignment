# PRG1 Assignment, Sundrop farm

This was my Programming one final assignment project, developing a farming simulation game called Sundrop farm.

>[!NOTE]
> This project was written when I didn't learn Object-Oriented Programming, So no OOP concept was used, for OOP, please check my other project, PRG 2 assignment. 


## Scope
You have taken out a loan to buy Sundrop Farm, located in scenic Albatross Town. Can you
make enough money to pay off your loan of $100 in 20 days?

In this “farming simulation” strategy game, you start with $20 and a 5x5 plot of farmland. You
can buy seeds for different crops at Pierce’s Store and plant them on your farm. There are 3
different types of crops. Each crop has a different cost, time to grow, and sell price when
harvested. 

After a seed is planted, you must wait the required number of days for it to fully
mature before you can harvest it for a profit.

Walking on your farm, planting a seed and harvesting a crop takes 1 energy each, and you
only have 10 energy each day. If you have at least $100 after 20 days, you win the game.

For this assignment, you are expected to:
- Understand the problem completely and plan your program layout before you start coding
- Develop the solution for each task by using functions
- Functions developed should be as generic as possible - values used in functions should
be passed in as the function parameters
- You may use global variables sparingly
- Implement and test each feature as it is developed
- Do all the relevant data validations
